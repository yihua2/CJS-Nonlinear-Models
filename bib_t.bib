 abstract = {In dose?response studies, the dose range is often restricted because of concerns over drug toxicity and/or efficacy. We derive optimal designs for estimating the underlying dose?response curve for a restricted or unrestricted dose range with respect to a broad class of optimality criteria. The underlying curve belongs to a diversified set of link functions suitable for the dose?response studies and having a common canonical form. These include the fundamental binary response models?the logit and the probit, as well as the skewed versions of these models. Our methodology is based on a new geometric interpretation of optimal designs with respect to Kiefer's ?p criteria in regression models with two parameters, which is of independent interest. It provides an intuitive illustration of the number and locations of the support points of ?p-optimal designs. Moreover, the geometric results generalize the classical characterization of D-optimal designs by the minimum covering ellipsoid to the class of Kiefer's ?p criteria. The results are illustrated through the redesign of a dose ranging trial.},

Applying the theory of Tchebycheff Systems and other algebraic tools, we show that the locally D-, A-, and c-optimal designs for three binary dose-response models are minimally supported in finite, closed design intervals. The methods to obtain such designs are presented along with examples. The efficiencies of these designs are also discussed.

 abstract = {Logit and probit, the two most common techniques for estimation of models with a dichotomous dependent variable, impose the assumption that individuals with a probability of .5 of choosing either of two alternatives are most sensitive to changes in independent variables. This assumption is imposed by the estimation technique because both the logistic and normal density functions are symmetric about zero. Rather than let methodology dictate substantive assumptions, I propose an alternative distribution for the disturbances to the normal or logistic distribution. The resulting estimator developed here, scobit (or skewed-logit), is shown to be appropriate where individuals with any initial probability of choosing either of two alternatives are most sensitive to changes in independent variables. I then demonstrate that voters with initial probability of voting of less than .5 are most sensitive to changes in independent variables. And I examine whether individuals with low levels of education or high levels of education are most sensitive to changes in voting laws with respect to their probability of voting.},

 abstract = {A convenient three-parameter class of asymmetric dose-response models can be obtained by raising the logistic response function to the power m, for m > 0. For these models, called power logistic quantal response models, D-optimal two point designs for various choices of m are numerically derived. We then investigate design efficiencies and design robustness to misspecification of the three model parameters for two point designs relative to the D-optimal two point design. It turns out that if the experimenter assumes an incorrect value of m when determining a design, the loss of efficiency incurred as a result is fairly small for a wide range of m, assuming no error in the initial values of the other parameters. Moreover, the effects of poor initial values of the other parameters seem more serious when m is large than when m is small, so that special care should be taken when m is large.},

 abstract = {The relationship between response probability and dosage in quantal response bioassay is modelled using a four parameter class. In addition to location and scale quantities the model includes two shape parameters that essentially index skewness and heaviness of tails of the dose-response curve. The class of models includes such special cases as the logistic, normal, extreme minimum value, extreme maximum value, double exponential, exponential and reflected exponential distribution functions. Score tests are derived for logistic and normal hypotheses and certain submodels are discussed for which the model fitting is computationally convenient. The data of Bliss [1935] illustrates the potential improvement over usual methods in the estimation of critical dose levels.},
